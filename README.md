> **Warning**
> This pack is very experimental! For improved performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) or [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) (for Fabric) over this pack. They have more performance improvements and update faster too.
> Also, for a plain and simple performance pack, use [Hammer](https://modrinth.com/modpack/hammer), the pack based on Adrenaline.


Drill is a modpack designed as an **alternative to OptiFine**. It includes the majority of OptiFine's features, such as built-in shader support, a vast improvement in rendering and logic performance, extra features for resource packs to utilize, a zoom feature, OptiFine and custom capes support, and [much more](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine). It also includes a small amount of [extra features](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Extra-features), such as input fixes for MacOS and Linux along with a free and easy-to-use world hosting feature. Want your own mods that aren't included in Drill? Don't worry! You can easily add your favorite mods after installation.

# ‚≠ê Features

### üöÄ Major performance improvement

Drill is based on and kept in sync with the [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) modpack. Adrenaline's aim is to emulate OptiFine without compromising performance. This is done with various optimization mods that are actively tested for stability and improvement. Some mods are also pre-configured. Additive wouldn't exist without projects like [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), so I advise you to donate to mod authors and contributors if you can.

For the list of performance mods that are included, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/skywardmc/adrenaline/wiki/Performance-features).

### üîç OptiFine alternatives

Drill utilizes various mods that offers the same features that OptiFine did while also being modular so that you can remove features you don't want or features that are incompatible with other mods. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Major performance boost from [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline)
- OptiFine resource pack features
- Built-in shaders support
- Dynamic lighting from held objects
- Better grass and snow
- OptiFine donator capes (and [free capes](https://github.com/skywardmc/Additive/wiki/Supporter-cape))
- [All OptiFine features and more information on the wiki](https://github.com/skywardmc/Additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine)

### üí° Other things

Drill also includes some extra features unrelated to OptiFine, although I aim to keep this list of mods minimal. Mods are suitable for the "other features" section if they are lightweight and unobtrusive. This includes things like:

- Small input fixes for MacOS and Linux players
- World hosting feature which lets you effortlessly open your LAN world freely and securely
- Borderless fullscreen window setting in the video settings
- [All other features and more information on the wiki](https://github.com/skywardmc/Additive/wiki/Extra-features)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Source-available

All mods in Drill are either open-source or source-available, which means you can view the code of mods and see exactly what they are doing. Drill is also available as [packwiz projects on GitHub](https://github.com/skywardmc/drill) so that you can easily view what's being changed, contribute if you would like to, or fork the modpack to create your own project. If you would like to view the mods shipped with Drill, simply look at the dependencies in the Modrinth page or look in the Git repository.

# ‚ùì Why Over OptiFine?

OptiFine used to be the go-to solution for enhancing performance in Minecraft and offered many additional features that users loved. However, recent developments have changed the situation. OptiFine functions as a type of "all-in-one" mod, making it impossible to disable certain features that are incompatible with other mods. Additionally, its closed-source nature presents a challenge for modders who are unable to fix compatibility issues. OptiFine is not natively compatible with Fabric or Quilt and requires a separate mod, OptiFabric, which is difficult to keep up to date. This has led to the creation of alternative mods that work just as well, if not better, and are easier to update. Drill usually updates much quicker than OptiFine does. While the transition may take some time to get used to, the overall experience is much improved compared to OptiFine.

For a full list of currently supported features, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine).

# ‚úÖ Hardware Compatibility

Drill supports the use of graphics cards with drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in 2010 or later are compatible. This includes the following hardware:

- Intel HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer
- Nvidia GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer
- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer

In some cases, older graphics cards may also work (as long as they have drivers which support OpenGL 3.3) but they are not officially supported and may not be compatible in the future.

Android devices that use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will likely not work with Drill's set of mods. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.

If you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. I also recommend taking a look at [this page](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) on the Sodium wiki.

*The majority of this was taken from Sodium's hardware compatibility section. I'll update this accordingly if anything is changed.*

# Updates?

Recently, updates to Drill have been sparse due to limited time on my end. I try to do the best I can, but it isn't enough here. However, Drill is not discontinued.
